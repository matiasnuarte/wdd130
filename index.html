        <p>Hey everyone! I am from Argentina, Mendoza. It's a beautiful city near the mountains.

            I am 26 years old and have been married for almost 3 years. I'm a Talent Acquisition Specialist at a software development company where I fell in love with the tech world.
            
            I love playing guitar and singing when I have time to do so. We have a lot of guitars and other instruments at home (but I always use the same guitar lol).
            
            I just switched my business major to applied tech because I have the goal to combine both areas for my career.</p>

        <p>Argentina, a diverse South American nation, offers stunning landscapes from the Andes to the Atlantic coast. Our culture blends European, indigenous, and immigrant influences seen in our cuisine and music. Buenos Aires, our vibrant capital, is famed for tango and bustling streets. Explore natural wonders like Iguazu Falls and Patagonia's glaciers. Football is our national obsession, reflecting our passion and identity.</p>
